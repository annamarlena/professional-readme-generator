# Professional README Generator

## Objective

The objective of this project was to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input. The final README file includes a Table of Contents with links to the contents, a dynamically generated badge to the license that was selected, and links to the project creator's GitHub and email.
